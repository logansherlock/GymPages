Adjust the pad height so that your upper arms rest flat against the angled bench with armpits just above the top edge. Grasp an EZ‑curl bar, straight bar, or dumbbells with an underhand grip and extend your arms fully to load the triceps. Exhale as you curl the weight upward by flexing the elbows, keeping the upper arms stationary against the pad. Squeeze the biceps at peak contraction and pause for one to two seconds to reinforce mind–muscle connection. Inhale as you slowly lower the weight under control until the arms are fully extended but without unlocking the elbows. Perform 3–4 sets of 8–12 reps with a 2‑second concentric and 3‑second eccentric tempo. Variations include one‑arm preacher curls for unilateral focus or drop sets for added intensity. Preacher Curls strengthen the biceps peak, improve elbow joint stability, and prevent cheating by eliminating torso involvement.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/tciCEtwnGuc'),('Push_Press','Push Press','push','expert','compound',8,'shoulders','Push Press is a compound overhead pressing movement that combines lower‐body drive with upper‐body pressing to build explosive shoulder and triceps strength. Start with feet hip‑width apart under a barbell racked at shoulder height, hands just outside shoulder‑width. Engage the core and dip by bending the knees approximately 10–15% of standing height, keeping the torso upright and elbows slightly forward. Explode upward by extending the hips and knees, driving the barbell off the shoulders, then immediately press through the arms to lock out overhead. Keep the bar path vertical and core braced to prevent excessive lumbar arching. At lockout, fully extend the elbows with wrists stacked over the mid‑foot. Lower the bar under control to the shoulders, absorb with a slight knee bend, then reset for the next rep. Perform 3–5 sets of 5–8 reps, focusing on synchronized leg drive and arm press. Variations include single‑arm push presses or push jerks for advanced power training. Push Press increases overhead power, enhances shoulder stability, and allows heavier loads than strict pressing by leveraging leg drive.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDE7fgut2Zs'),('Romanian_Deadlift','Romanian Deadlift','pull','intermediate','compound',8,'hamstrings','Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is a hip‐hinge exercise that emphasizes the posterior chain—hamstrings, glutes, and spinal erectors—while reinforcing hip extension mechanics and maintaining spinal neutrality. Begin standing with feet hip‑width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand or mixed grip at thigh level. Slightly bend the knees (soft knees), brace the core, and retract the shoulder blades. Exhale as you hinge at the hips, pushing them backward while keeping the barbell close to the legs and the back flat. Lower the barbell until you feel a stretch in the hamstrings or until the bar passes the knees, typically mid‑shin height. Avoid rounding the back. Inhale as you drive the hips forward, squeezing the glutes to return to standing with the barbell returning to thigh level. Perform 3–5 sets of 6–12 reps with a controlled 3‑second eccentric and explosive concentric. Variations include single‐leg RDLs for unilateral strength or using dumbbells for grip emphasis.
